Here's a project idea that uses the PyQT5 library:

Project idea - Weather App using PyQT5

Create a desktop weather app using PyQT5 
that displays the current weather conditions for a given location (using an API such as OpenWeatherMap).

The app should include the following features:

A text input field where the user can enter the location (e.g. "London" or "New York")
A "Search" button that triggers a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather conditions for the specified location
Display of the current weather conditions (e.g. "Mostly Cloudy, 15Â°C")
A weather icon representing the current conditions (e.g. a cloud or a sun)
Additional information such as wind speed and humidity
Error handling for cases where the location cannot be found or the API request fails
To start with, you can create a simple PyQT5 UI with the input field 
button and labels to display the weather information. 
You can then use PyQT5 signals to connect the button click event to the API request and update the UI with the fetched information.
